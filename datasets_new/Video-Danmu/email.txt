Dear Hongwei Wang:	
	This is Yixuan Zhang, an undergraduate student from Nankai University.I read your article on the Danmu 
	[Visual-Texual Emotion Analysis With Deep Coupled Video and Danmu Neural Networks] and found it a very interesting and brilliant job.
	We are very interested in the dataset you annotated with emotional labels and would like to use it for further work
	If you would like to provide your dataset Video-Danmu, we will cite your paper once our work is done.
	If you require any further information, please let me know.
	Thanks a lot.
Best,
Yixuan
