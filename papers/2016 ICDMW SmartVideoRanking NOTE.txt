in this paper, we assume any comment is related to
an emotion and believe that such time-synchronized comments
are effective resources for obtaining useful responses for
searching videos on the basis of emotions.

Figure 1 gives an overview of our proposal together with
some examples. The query is “Len’s song”2. The first step is
to obtain videos related to the query. The second step is to
extract comments, such as “Great lyrics” and “So cute”, that
were posted on the videos. The third step computes feature
values for each comment. Here, each comment corresponds
to an emotion. Features are categorized into 14 groups such
as the query relevance (QREL) and query similarity (QSIM).
The fourth step uses machine learning to estimate the degree of usefulness of each comment. In this example, the
comment “Quite harmonious” is estimated to be the most
useful. SmartVideoRanking is implemented on the basis of
the estimated results
