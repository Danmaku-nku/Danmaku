we present and release a new Chinese movie review dataset,
consisting of two contemporary data types: comments and Danmaku
with annotated entity-level sentiment labels.
These datasets provide a new perspective for entity-based sentiment classification,
making the dataset ideal for exploring the interaction of sentiment classification on video comments.

Table 1 shows the coding book for categorizing diferent sentiment polarity of 
Danmaku and comments. We use the majority voting rules [12] to choose the correct label. If more than fve annotators voted the same label, we set the tag as ground 
truth. Finally, we receive 13,903 comments and 3415 Danmaku as our experiment 
datasets.


• We have collected two kinds of movie review corpus, namely Danmaku and 
comments from popular video website iQiYi.7
 We preprocess the data by 
Tokenization, POStagging as preparation data.
• We use open-source tools and algorithms to label the data automatically (e.g., 
Paddlehub,8
 SnowNlp9
). Then, we aggregate the results to reduce checking complexity.
• We recruit six undergraduate students in a Chinese research university who love 
watching TV to check the annotation tagging results. For this case, we use the 
following litmus test: If the Danmaku or comment contains negative emotions 
for the given entity (e.g., dislike, angry, hate, abuse), it belongs to the negative class. If the Danmaku or comment contains positive emotions for the given 
entity (e.g., like, happy, praise), then it belongs to the positive class. Otherwise, 
there is no emotional tendency, and it belongs to neutral. For example, the following comment “Zhangsan is not good at acting, Lisi is so beautiful” can be 
classifed onto the negative class for “Zhangsan” (Entity) and positive class for 
“Lisi” (Entity).
• We fnally collect the labeled corpus as datasets for the entity-level sentiment 
classifcation task.
